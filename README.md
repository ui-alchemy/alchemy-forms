## Component Scaffold

This repository is a bare bones scaffolding of the structural layout of a component. The structure is based off of the
Yeoman generator-angular project layout.

### Layout

* app/ - contains a basic AngularJS application for serving up your component's assets live for development  
* test/ - all tests go here  
* component/ - where all the assets of a component lives (directives, styles, and templates)  
* component.json - used for Bower installs and management  
* package.json - used mostly for development purposes with nodejs and npm
